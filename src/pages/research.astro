    <div class="mb-12">
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        My research focuses on the interdisciplinary areas of physical and chemical oceanography, data management, analysis, and visualization of marine data. These fields are crucial for understanding the marine environment and developing innovative solutions to tackle oceanographic challenges. This approach has enabled me to effectively manage and analyze marine data, transforming raw oceanographic data into actionable insights. Currently, my research involves developing methods and tools for data analysis, quality control, and integration, as well as designing visualization tools to improve the interpretation of marine data.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
       I am interested in learning how to develop user-friendly toolboxes that enable researchers and stakeholders to effectively explore and 
       analyse oceanographic information. These tools should support various applications, from academic research to policy development and 
       environmental management. My goal is to support long-term monitoring and data sharing within the scientific community, by improving the 
       accessibility and reliability of data, and promoting collaboration and informed decision-making in marine science.

Blue-Cloud 2026 aims to further develop this pilot ecosystem into a federated European ecosystem, i.e. a thematic marine extension of EOSC for open web-based science that meets the needs of the EU Blue Economy, Marine Environment and Marine Knowledge agendas. I am engaged as tecnical an scientific contact person for Virtual Lab4, 'Marine Environmental Indicators' and the 'EOV Workbench for Eutrophication: Chlorophyll, Nutrients, Oxygen'.

Specifically, FAIR-EASE is part of those actions focused on driving the implementation and the operationalisation of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC): the EU ecosystem of research data and related services. FAIR-EASE contributes to attain the vision of a Web of FAIR data and services for science by advancing EOSC in a more cohesive and structured manner. The project aims at integrating and customising a set of services scaled up at a higher technology readiness level that will allow scientists and machines to collaborate in storing, processing, finding, accessing and reusing scientific data in an open way. I am involved as OGS tecnical and scientific contact person for Ocean Bio-geochemical observation' pilot. For more information, visit the FAIR-EASE website:",
